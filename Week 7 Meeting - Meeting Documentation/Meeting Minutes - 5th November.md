**State of Completed Actions:**
- Each of us has improved our use case diagrams, ensuring that the connection arrows are in the right direction, as well as making use of relation connections. 
- Some of us have continued to work on the activity diagrams. 
- We have done research into creating the system architecture models. 
- We have all cloned and committed our diagrams to the group Git repository.
 
**Cross-checking the diagrams for the project:**
- The group reviewed Gonzalez’s Activity diagram, which included some of the changes suggested by the group last week. Gauthier also noted additional improvements from adding central buffer nodes in his diagram.
- The group reviewed Charlotte’s updated Use Case diagram, in which she had implemented changes to the connection arrows and implemented relation connections. Charlotte had suggested a change of adding the select society use case to connect to the search society, which the group agreed with. 

**Discuss the plan for the group’s System Architecture Model:**
- The group is planning for the system architecture to each work on their individual subsystem components, and then one member will be responsible for combining all the components together. We designated Ryan to be responsible for combining and creating the final model. 

**Actions to take place after the meeting:**
- We will start planning our individual System Architecture Model. 
- We create draft versions of the System Architecture Models. 
- Additionally, Charlotte will carry on working with the Activity Diagram, so that it can be cross-checked next week.

**Issues to be solved:**
- Some of us have struggled with understanding the different concepts on the system architecture model, so we will do our own research and get advice from the lecturer
