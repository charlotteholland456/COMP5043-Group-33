Progress Since Previous Meeting (State of Completed Actions):
We have done research into creating the system architecture models, as well as created our draft individual models. 
We have all finalised our activity diagrams based on one use case from our subsystems. 
We have all cloned and committed our diagrams to the group Git repository.

Cross-checking the finalised activity diagrams:
As we have all finalised our activity diagrams, we will cross-check them. Therefore, we can provide recommendations for improvements. 

Cross-checking the system architectural models:
We will all cross-check each other's individual system architecture models, so that we can all be provided with recommendations for improvement. 
Each of us will carry on working on this model throughout the rest of the week, while implementing the improvement recommendations. 

Actions to take place after the meeting:
We will attempt to finish the architectural designs of the subsystems before next week’s meeting, so that we will be able to integrate the architectural designs of the subsystems. 
We will start to work on task 5 of the project, which is to create the structural model, by selecting one component in the architectural design of the subsystem. Therefore, the model can be cross-checked in next week’s meeting. 

Issues to be solved:
Discuss any confusion and uncertainties related to the collaborative project. 
Identify any issues that require further clarification from the lecturer or through additional research.
