Progress Since Previous Meeting (State of Completed Actions)
We have all created our Software Architecture Diagrams for Part A, so we can combine them for Part B. 
We have created our draft structural models using Papyrus. 

Cross-checking the Software Architecture Diagrams:
As we have all created the software architecture diagrams for each subsystem, we will cross-check them. Therefore, we can provide recommendations for improvements. 

Cross-checking the Structural Models:
We will all cross-check each other's Structural Models, so that we can all be provided with recommendations for improvement. 
Each of us will carry on working on this model throughout the rest of the week, while implementing the improvement recommendations. 

Discuss the Whole System Architecture Model:
We will discuss how we will connect all of the individual Software Architecture Models, so we can create the whole Software Architecture Model.

Actions to take place after the meeting:
We will finalise the Structural Models, based on the feedback from the cross-checking on the draft version. 
We will work on the draft behaviour diagrams. 
We will all start working on the whole architectural model that connects all of the subsystems. 

Issues to be solved:
Discuss any confusion and uncertainties related to the collaborative project. 
Identify any issues that require further clarification from the lecturer or through additional research.
