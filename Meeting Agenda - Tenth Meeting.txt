Progress Since Previous Meeting (State of Completed Actions)
We have all created our individual software architectural models for each subsystem,  so we can bring them all together for the whole software architecture model.
We improved the structural models, regarding the cross-checking from the previous meeting. 
Individually, we created the draft versions of the behaviour models. 

Cross-checking the behaviour models:
As we have all created the draft versions of the behaviour models, we will cross-check them. Therefore, we can provide recommendations for improvements. 

Planning the team work report:
We are going to plan who is working on which part of the report, as there are multiple things that need to be included. 
Charlotte will explain how she has created a shared google document for all of us to work collaboratively. 

Discuss the Whole System Architecture Model:
We will discuss the process of creating the whole system architecture model, so we can make sure that everyone understands. 

Actions to take place after the meeting:
We will finalise the Behaviour models, based on the feedback from the cross-checking on the draft version. 
We will finalise our diagrams for the Software Engineering Project. 
We will write our individual reports 
We will work on the group report collaboratively. 

Issues to be solved:
Discuss any confusion and uncertainties related to the collaborative project. 
Identify any issues that require further clarification from the lecturer or through additional research.
