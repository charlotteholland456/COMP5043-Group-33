State of completion of actions:
Allocated each member of the group a subsystem of the project, and discussed the functional requirements.
Improved each of our quality requirements analysis, based on the feedback and questions, when we reported the requirements to the group at the last meeting. 

Report on quality requirements:
Each member of the group will come to the meeting with their finalised analysis document outlining the quality requirements of their chosen subsystem.
We will all cross-check each of our quality requirements analysis, so we can see if any minor improvements need to be made before they get uploaded to GitHub. 

Actions to take place after the meeting:
We will upload each of our finalised quality requirements analysis to Git Hub.
We will plan how each of us will develop a draft of our use case models for each subsystem. 
We will also remind each other to upload our draft use case models to the GitHub repository, so they can be cross-checked during next weekâ€™s meeting. 

Issues to be solved:
Discuss any confusion and uncertainties related to the collaborative project. 
Identify any issues that require further clarification from the lecturer or through additional research.
