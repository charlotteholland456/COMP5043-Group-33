**State of Completed Actions:**
- Each of us has finalised our use case and activity diagrams based on the feedback from cross-checking.   
- We have done research into creating the Software Architecture diagrams.     
 
**Cross-Checking Charlotte’s Diagrams:**    
- We reviewed Charlotte’s use case diagram and all members were happy with it, with no issues identified.    
- Therefore, we do not think any refinements need to be implemented.     

**Discuss the process of cloning the Papyrus and GitHub:**
- During the meeting, Charlotte and Ryan helped Gonzalez clone his Papyrus to the Git repository. However, he is going to do independent research into doing the push commits, as for some reason, the staged and unstaged changes were presented as empty. 
- We couldn’t clone Gauthier’s, as there were technical errors with his Papyrus software. We will sort this out next week. 

**Actions to take place after the meeting:**
- The rest of the team will commit from Papyrus the use case diagrams and activity diagrams
- We will all start planning our system architecture models, so they can be cross-checked in the upcoming meeting. 

**Issues to be solved:**
- As for the issues with the metadata, Charlotte has a meeting with Hong Zhu next week. However, our Software Engineering project should run smoothly, as Ryan got the issue resolved today.
